# packageless-pims
The packageless-pims repository is a supporting repository to [packageless](https://github.com/everettraven/packageless) that serves to store the pim configuration files that packageless uses for installing pims. This repository is, as of now, the official repository to get pims from and is the default in the packageless configuration file.
