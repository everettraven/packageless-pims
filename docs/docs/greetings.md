Welcome! Thanks for checking out the packageless-pims documentation!

The packageless-pims repository is a supporting repository to [packageless](https://github.com/everettraven/packageless) that serves to store the pim configuration files that packageless uses for installing pims. This repository is, as of now, the official repository to get pims from and is the default in the packageless configuration file.

If you would like to create your own pims repository you can follow the instructions in the [Creating a pim repository](create-pim-repo.md) section of these docs.

If you would like to contribute to the packageless-pims repository you can follow the [Contributing Guidelines](contributing.md).
